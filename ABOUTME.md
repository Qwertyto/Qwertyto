- 👋 Hey, I’m @Qwertyto
- 👀 I’m interested in music, gaming, and privacy-oriented tech
- 🌱 I’m currently learning every way to please your mom (and html, CSS, and NES ROMhacking lmao)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that could learn from via experience, although im not exactly a star candidate...
- 📫 How to reach me: qiscordio@protonmail.com

I dont believe I will be capable of making any solo projects anytime soon. I'm just making this account because I'm starting to use open source software more often and seeing this site all the time.
